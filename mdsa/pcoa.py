    """Perform Principal Coordinate Analysis using a given algorithm to do so.

    Adapted from scikit-bio.

    Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA) is a method similar to PCA
    that works from distance matrices, and so it can be used with
    ecologically meaningful distances like UniFrac for bacteria.
    In ecology, the euclidean distance preserved by Principal
    Component Analysis (PCA) is often not a good choice because it
    deals poorly with double zeros (Species have unimodal
    distributions along environmental gradients, so if a species is
    absent from two sites at the same site, it can't be known if an
    environmental variable is too high in one of them and too low in
    the other, or too low in both, etc. On the other hand, if an
    species is present in two sites, that means that the sites are
    similar.).

    Note: the incoming distance matrix is centered before being passed to the
    specified PCoA algorithm.

    Parameters
    ----------
    algorithm : Algorithm
        Algorithm to use to decompose matrix into eigenvectors and eigenvalues
    num_dimensions_out
        k number of dimensions to return: selects k eigenvectors
        corresponding to the k largest eigenvalues
    distance_matrix : DistanceMatrix
        A distance matrix.
    Returns
    -------
    OrdinationResults
        Object that stores the PCoA results, including eigenvalues, the
        proportion explained by each of them, and transformed sample
        coordinates.
    See Also
    --------
    OrdinationResults
    Notes
    -----
    It is sometimes known as metric multidimensional scaling or
    classical scaling.
    .. note::
       If the distance is not euclidean (for example if it is a
       semimetric and the triangle inequality doesn't hold),
       negative eigenvalues can appear. There are different ways
       to deal with that problem (see Legendre & Legendre 1998, \\S
       9.2.3), but none are currently implemented here.
       However, a warning is raised whenever negative eigenvalues
       appear, allowing the user to decide if they can be safely
       ignored.
